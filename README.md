# Water Supply System

## Overview

Welcome to Water Supply Analysis tool! This tool is designed to analyze the water supply network and provide insights into maximizing water distribution efficiency, identifying critical areas, and evaluating network resilience.


## Objectives

- Implementing a water supply management analysis tool using greedy algorithmic approaches, particularly in the context of maximum-flow problems.
- Creating a user-friendly interface for showcasing functionalities and conducting short presentations.


## Description

The water supply network system provided in this project consists of various elements such as water reservoirs, pumping stations, and delivery sites. The task is to develop functionalities to address two main sets of questions:

- [x]  Basic Service Metrics: Determine maximum water flow to each city, check if the existing network configuration meets water demand, and balance load across the network.
- [x]  Reliability and Sensitivity to Failures: Evaluate network resilience by simulating failures of water reservoirs, pumping stations, and pipelines, and analyze the impact on water supply to cities.

## Dataset

The dataset stores in CSV files and  includes information about water reservoirs, pumping stations, delivery sites, and pipelines of Portugal and Madeira.

### Data Handling

- Read and parse data, loading in into an appropriate data structure.

## Tasks 

- [x] Developing a Water Supply Management Analysis System Menu.
- [x] Reading and parsing the input data to create graph representations.
- [x] Implementing algorithms for determining maximum water flow, assessing network configuration, load balancing, and evaluating network resilience.
- [x] Documenting the implemented code using Doxygen and analyzing time complexity.

## Setup
